## Project Overview
### Introduction:
The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 led to unprecedented disruptions across various sectors, with the airline industry being one of the hardest-hit. This project aims to analyze the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on global airline traffic patterns during the year 2020. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we seek to gain insights into how travel restrictions, lockdown measures, and public health concerns affected air travel behavior worldwide.

### Problem Statement:
The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 has severely impacted the global airline industry, leading to unprecedented disruptions in air travel patterns. As countries implemented various containment measures, including travel restrictions and lockdowns, airline traffic experienced significant fluctuations, with profound implications for airlines, airports, and related stakeholders. However, there remains a critical need to systematically analyze the extent and nature of these disruptions, understand the underlying factors driving changes in airline traffic behavior, and identify actionable insights to inform future strategies and policies.

This project seeks to address the following key questions:

- What is the total flight recorded for this analysis?
- What is the total traffic impact?
- What is the average percent of baseline?
- What is the total flights recorded by Country?
- What is the number of Airports, Countries and Cities in this analysis?
- What is the overall traffic impact by Country? Use a chart.
- With the help of a chart, display the flights trend monthly was recorded within the period of this analysis?
- Using a chart, show the contributions of different Airports to the overall traffic impact?
- Using geospatial mapping, showcase the percentage of baseline by Airport, Country, Stae and City?
- What actionable insights can be derived from the analysis to assist stakeholders in the aviation industry and policymakers in adapting strategies and mitigating future risks associated with similar crises?

### Expected Outcomes:

- Total Flight Recorded: The analysis will provide the total number of flights recorded within the specified period, offering a comprehensive view of the scale of air traffic during the time frame under consideration.

- Total Traffic Impact: By comparing pre-pandemic levels of air traffic with those during the pandemic period, the analysis will quantify the total impact on air traffic, providing insights into the severity of disruptions experienced by the airline industry.

- Average Percent of Baseline: Calculating the average percentage of baseline traffic will offer a standardized measure to gauge the overall reduction in air travel activity relative to pre-pandemic levels.

- Total Flights Recorded by Country: This outcome will present a breakdown of the total number of flights recorded for each country, enabling a comparative analysis of the impact across different regions.

- Number of Airports, Countries, and Cities: Providing counts of airports, countries, and cities included in the analysis will offer contextual information about the scope and geographic coverage of the dataset.

- Overall Traffic Impact by Country (Chart): A chart depicting the overall traffic impact by country will visually illustrate the varying degrees of disruption experienced across different countries.

- Monthly Flight Trend (Chart): Visualizing the monthly flight trend will enable stakeholders to identify temporal patterns and fluctuations in air travel activity over the course of the analysis period.

- Contributions of Different Airports (Chart): Displaying the contributions of different airports to the overall traffic impact will highlight the relative importance of various air transportation hubs in shaping the overall traffic patterns.

- Geospatial Mapping of Baseline Percentage: Using geospatial mapping, the analysis will showcase the percentage of baseline traffic by airport, country, state, and city, offering a spatial perspective on the distribution of air traffic disruptions.

- Actionable Insights: Drawing from the analysis results, actionable insights will be derived to assist stakeholders in the aviation industry and policymakers in adapting strategies and mitigating future risks associated with similar crises. These insights may include recommendations for route optimization, capacity planning, health and safety protocols, policy adjustments, and crisis management strategies.

### About The Dataset
This dataset shows traffic to and from the Airport as a Percentage of the Traffic volume during the baseline period. The baseline period used for computing this metric is from 1st Feb to 15th March 2020. The dataset gets updated monthly. This data is publicly available from [Geotab](https://www.geotab.com/). The dataset is in .csv file and can be viewed or downloaded [here](covid_impact_on_airport_traffic.csv)
